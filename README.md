# plant-soil-feedback
Repository to storing the documentation and code for a project investigating the effect of resources and microbial communities on competition between native and invasive plant species.

Measure a few plants for belowground biomass of each species and then maybe there will be a good empirical relationship.

### To-do

Check with Elias about how invasives, natives and the combinations were planted exactly as we might have to adapt the simulations.
