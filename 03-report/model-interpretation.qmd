How do we interpret these models in the context of plant-soil feedback? Bates et al. (2019) go through the various methods available to estimate the strength of plant-soil feedback along with the uncertainty in the estimate. In this paper, we use model fitting to do this (paraphrasing):

The method involves using **regression model fitting** to estimate ( \hat{f_2} ) and its associated **standard error**:

To estimate the standard error of $$\hat{f_2}$$, a regression model can be fitted using the log-transformed plant weights as the response variable. The data from both treatments (WT and WS) are combined, and soil treatment is included as a categorical explanatory variable, with treatment T set as the reference class. This approach is equivalent to performing a one-way ANOVA on log-transformed plant weights.

In this model, the parameter of interest is the estimated difference in the mean log-transformed plant weights between treatment S and the reference treatment T:

$$
\hat{f_2} = \overline{\log(W_T)} - \overline{\log(W_S)}
$$

The regression output also provides the associated standard error, $$SE_{\hat{f_2}}$$, which can be used to construct confidence intervals for $$f_2$$. When sample sizes are equal across treatments, this method produces the same mean and standard error as analytical formulas (e.g. Eqs. 4 and 5 in the source). However, model fitting has the advantage of producing the correct standard error when sample sizes differ between treatments, making it a more robust approach in unbalanced designs.
