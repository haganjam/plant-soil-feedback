You can access .html previews of the following documents that we used to plan the experiment:

## 01-design

This documents the initial design of the experiment. It includes the rationale, hypotheses and methods that we developed *prior* to performing the experiment. It is possible that changes will occur to this design but these will be documented in subsequent documentation.

See the html preview [here](https://htmlpreview.github.io/?https://github.com/haganjam/plant-soil-feedback/blob/main/01-plan/01-study-design/01-design.html)

## 02-data-simulation

This is an overview of the expected structure of the data, the models that we will use to test the various hypotheses and various other kinds of planning for the analysis.

## 03-power-analysis

In this quarto document, we run a power-analysis that was used to plan our experiment:
