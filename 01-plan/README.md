# Pre-registered analysis

You can access .html previews of the following documents that we used to plan the experiment:
  
## 01-design

This is a documenting the initial design of the experiment. It includes the rationale, hypotheses and methods that we developed *prior* to performing the experiment. It is possible that changes will occur to this design but these will be documented in subsequent documentation.

See the html preview [here]()

## 02-power-analysis

This document shows the results of the power analysis that we conducted in order to balance statistical power with logistical constraints and our design to investigate as many different invasive species as possible. Our chosen sample sizes were therefore justified by reaching at least 50% power under reasonable estimates of variation.

## 03-analysis-plan

Here, we document and simulate the analyses that we plan to conduct in order to test our hypotheses. If the experiment goes to plan, we will use these exact methods to analyse our experimental data.
