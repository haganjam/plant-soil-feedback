I actually think that two experiments are required here. The first experiment would be estimate the plant soil feedback of natives with changing nitrogen.

The second experiment would be to see how the competitive effect of invasives on natives changes with nitrogen with and without microbes (this is what we discussed). However, for this, I think the microbe treatment should be natives and invasives for the pots where the invasive is not present.
